(Verse 1)
In the heart of Addis, where the rhythm flows,
Ethio-jazz whispers, where the spirit grows.
A soulful saxophone, a beat so deep,
Secrets of the ancient, the melodies keep.

(Chorus)
Oh, Ethiopian jazz, a mystical sound,
On sacred ground, where the legends are found.
From the bustling markets to the quiet night,
Guiding our souls with its vibrant light.

(Verse 2)
The krar's gentle strum, the masenqo's cry,
Stories of the ages, reaching for the sky.
A fusion of cultures, a vibrant blend,
A journey through time, that will never end.

(Chorus)
Oh, Ethiopian jazz, a mystical sound,
On sacred ground, where the legends are found.
From the bustling markets to the quiet night,
Guiding our souls with its vibrant light.
